# Cache-Simulator-with-Visual-Interface
A cache simulator with a hit checking mechanism, a mapping display of memory addresses and cache blocks, the implementation of a substitution algorithm, the handling of mismatches between the block size and the data size, and the separation of the data cache from the instruction cache. And with visual interface.
